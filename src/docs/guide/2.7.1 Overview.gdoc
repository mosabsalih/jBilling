This section provides an introduction to the use of *j*Billing integration calls. It builds on the 'Trend' tutorial 
found in *j*Billing's *[Getting Started|http://www.jbilling.com/documentation/getting-started-with-jbilling]* guide. 
As such, if you wish to follow the examples in this section, you'll need to follow the *[Getting Started|http://www.jbilling.com/documentation/getting-started-with-jbilling]* Guide
tutorial, creating the Trend entity and adding the Items and Orders. The examples in this section will mainly use the 
+jBilling client API+. If you're unable to use this API (most probably because your system does not make use of the Java 
programming language), you'll need to substitute the API calls with direct SOAP requests. Please, refer to the Integrating *j*Billing to your 
Application chapter, which explains the options for performing service calls to *j*Billing in more detail and provides
examples for some programming languages and SOAP APIs available.
